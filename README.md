# hauntedhouse


## Description
This is a text-based adventure game for the console written in C++  as part of Week 02 Assignment for the Game Developer bootcamp at [The Developer Academy](https://www.thedeveloperacademy.com).

The text-based adventure game is very loosely based on the the most haunted house in the United Kingdom, the notorious Borley Rectory. It is a first person game where the player's little brother is lost and presumably detained by the infamous "Ghost of the Headless Man". The player is to move around in the various rooms in the Borley Rectory to do a series of tasks and challenges before being able to uncover the location of the player's little brother by first pacifying the "Ghost of the Headless Man".

This is a joint project by

* Pei  [github.com/HaveTimeDrinkTea](https://github.com/HaveTimeDrinkTea)


### Methodology: Pseudo Code
* We started with the layout of the sub-section of the layout of the Borley Rectory.
* We plotted the main story line and took note of the MVP for this game.
* Through the story plotting, we identified the C++ classes, objects, subroutines and game play loop and logic controls.
